-This repository contains the code of a Budget Management System made using the object oriented approach using C++.

-This code helps you maintain your monthly budget and have a preview of it.

-The file handling and folder structure is still left to be implemented.

-In future this will be converted to template which we can later use to produce graphical outputs.
